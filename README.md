# AoC 2022

This is a repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code][1] challenges for the
year 2022.

Advent of Code is an annual event in which programming challenges are released
each day from December 1st to December 25th. These challenges are
self-contained and are meant to be solved using a programming language of your
choice.
